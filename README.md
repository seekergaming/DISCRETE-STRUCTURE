# DISCRETE STRUCTURE

This course introduces students to the principles and applications of discrete structure in the field
of computer science. The topics that are covered in this course are set theory, proof techniques,
relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees and finite
automata. At the end of the course, the students should be able to use set theory, relations and
functions to solve computer science problems, analyze and solve problems using recurrence
relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees in real world problems and use
deterministic finite automata finite state machines to model electronic devices and problems.
